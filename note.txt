    here is the correct postion for routing

    "/"
   1. if u take /  thing at top it always execute "Iam express "
    if i change /hello , /test Also  it wont work
   2. so keep the default "/" one at the all route 
     below so it work good work for all Route
  
     "/test" & "/test/50"
    1. and one more order if u bring /test/id below the /test , that /test/50  it wont work 
    so keep /test/50 top of the /test
